# Home Automation System using Arduino

# Introduction:

This project involves the use of an Arduino board to create an automated system that can control various home appliances. The system is designed to be easily accessible and manageable by users. It includes several features such as light control, fan control, gas sensor, PIR sensor, LDR sensor, and a servo motor to control the door.

Hardware Requirements:

• Arduino Uno board

• Ultrasonic sensor

• Servo motor

• PIR sensor

• LDR sensor

• Gas sensor

• Relay module

• LED

• Piezo buzzer

• NPN transistor


# Software Requirements:

• Arduino IDE


# Installation:

Connect all the hardware components as per the circuit diagram.
Open the Arduino IDE and upload the code to the Arduino board.
Monitor the system’s performance by opening the serial monitor.
Usage:

The LDR sensor controls the light intensity based on the ambient light available in the room.
The PIR sensor detects motion, and the system turns on the fan automatically.
The gas sensor detects the gas level in the room, and if the level exceeds the predefined limit, an alarm sound is produced.
The servo motor controls the door based on the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor.
The LED indicators provide visual feedback on the system's current status.
Troubleshooting:

• Check the wiring connections for accuracy.

• Check the sensor's placement.

• Check the code for syntax errors.

# Conclusion:

This project offers an efficient way to automate home appliances, making them easily accessible to the user. The system is cost-effective, easy to install, and customizable to suit individual needs.
